# new level of verbosity for qlop, to print the total time
  qlop -vtH x11-proto/scrnsaverproto-1.1.0::gentoo x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-8.1::gentoo
   x11-proto/scrnsaverproto-1.1.0::gentoo : 5 seconds average for 1 merges
   x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-8.1::gentoo : 49 seconds average for 1 merge
   Total time: 54 seconds
# new options for qlop --estimate (-e), ignore the version:
  qlop  -vteH x11-proto/scrnsaverproto-1.1.0::gentoo x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-8.1::gentoo 
   x11-proto/scrnsaverproto-1.1.0::gentoo : 5 seconds average for 1 merges
   x11-terms/rxvt-unicode-8.1::gentoo : 48 seconds average for 2 merges
   Total time: 53 seconds

   =>TIP: to know how much time reinstalling world would take
    1) qlop -tvH $(qlist -IC)
     you can also play with qlist verbosity, to have something more or less accurate
   
    2) more accurate since it will check dependencies and so but...:
       qlop -tvH $(paludis -ip --dl-reinstall always --log-level silent world | sed -e '/^\* .*::/!d' -e 's;^..\([^/]*/[^:]*::[^ ]* \).*;\1;')
      but there are probably new packages;/version you've nvever installed yet, that's where the --estimate switch enter the game:)
       qlop -etvH $(paludis -ip --dl-reinstall always --log-level silent world | sed -e '/^\* .*::/!d' -e 's;^..\([^/]*/[^:]*::[^ ]* \).*;\1;')

== version 20070128 ==

# portage-utils now also support the repository_defaults.conf file 
it can read the cache, write_cache, and format keys
# little fix in the 'palsearch' script



== version 20070126 ==

# fix a little bug with the 'profiles/categories' file. This new version also
comes with a really small script: palsearch commented here:
 http://tinyurl.com/youn2x



== version 20070119 ==

# when (re)generating the cache, portage-utils now consider the
overlay/profiles/categories file, if this file doesn't exist, then it scan the
content of the overlay, otherwise it will only add the categories specified in
this file.

# purge enhancement: if an ebuild cache file is deleted, and if the category
doesn't contain anything else, then it is also deleted.



== version 20070118 ==

# more powerfull search can be achieved when searching with the name (ie not the DESCRIPTION):
 * to list every package from one category, in the overlay that regexp
 match pal.*a.$  :
  qsearch sys-apps/::pal.*a.$
   sys-apps/paludis::paludis-overlay paludis, the other package mangler
   sys-apps/paludis-hooks::paludis-extras This is a colection of various hooks used with Paludis.

 * Actually you can do almost what yo want, just think how qatom will split your
 string

 * note that doing 'qsearch -ao overlay' is faster than doing 'qsearch ::overlay',
 but with the first one you have to know the exact name of the overlay, while with
 the second you can do your search in every overaly but one, and so on.
  eg: qsearch ::[^overlay]

# little fix in qlop

# added a purge use flag, if enable, you'll then have the option --purge,
which will scan the cache paludis write (overlays with the key 'write_cache'
defined):
    * If an ebuild is no longer in the overlay then the ebuild cache is
 deleted.
    * It also regenerate the 'metacache' in the same time

# the q-reinitialise.bash hook provided with portage-utils, which already
reinitialise ebuild et meta cache, will now 'tell' paludis to write the cache 
for every repository with 'write_cache' defined (and format=ebuild)




== version 20070116 ==

# added support for versions: -{live,cvs,svn,scm} which are equal (also equal to
version -9999 for qatom
# qatom is now also overlay aware:)
 * e.g.:
  qatom sys-apps/einit-9999-r3::einit
  sys-apps einit 9999 r3 einit

# for paludis users:  portage-utils will load the vdb location defined in
etc/paludis/repositories/installed.conf instead of the hardcoded default
location

# modified qlist to reflect overlays existence (will work only for paludis
users, with the REPOSITORY key in the VDB)
e.g:
 * before:
  qlist -I
  app-admin/conky
  ..

 * and:
  qlist -Iv
  app-admin/conky-1.4.5
  ..

 * now, we have one more level of verbosity:
  qlist -Ivv
  app-admin/conky-1.4.5::gentoo
  ...

 * where 'gentoo' is the overlay from which the package come from,
 It works with the --installed, --umap, --slots and --dups options

# qsearch should now be able to use the cache, portage users will only have the cache for the gentoo overlay
while paludis users will have it whenever they defined it (key 'cache' or 'write_cache' in the
repo conf files) 
 * run q -l to list your defined overlays with their cache
 * You can make more usefull search with the cache:
 e.g.: To list and show the description of every package in a category just run:
  qsearch -c category/

 e.g.: To list and show the description of every package in a category in only 
 the overlay 'overlay', just run:
  qsearch -c category/::overlay


# gentoo overlay is no longer required to use portage-utils.  
=> .ebuild.x and .metadata.x default location is now (respectively)
/var/cache/paludis/{,metadata}

# possibility to defined CACHE_METADATA_FILE and/or CACHE_EBUILD_FILE
environment variable to use different (from the default) cache files 

# portage-utils now only recognise  the format=ebuild in the repository conf
files

# big changes in qlop, which now makes a better use of the atom, funny search
can be perform now, 
 * e.g.:
  qlop -t portage -H
  portage : 11 seconds average for 19 merges

  qlop -t portage-2.1.2_rc4 -H
  portage-2.1.2_rc4 : 13 seconds average for 8 merges

 * To know how much time you've spent compiling things from the
 paludis-overlay:
  qlop  -tvH ::paludis-overlay
  ::paludis-overlay : 20 minutes, 30 seconds average for 4 merges, for a total
  time of 1 hour, 22 minutes, 3 seconds

 * Or even how much time you've spent compiling things from the games-fps
 category:
  qlop  -tvH games-fps/
  games-fps/ : 3 minutes, 5 seconds average for 14 merges, for a total time of
  43 minutes, 21 seconds

  

TODO: fixe the tests for qatom... for paludis users (no python plz..:) <- fuck
it... anyone?
