# The default exception handler will either cause the program to simply terminate, or to crash - leaving a core

# The CRASH_ON_ABORT environment variable can be used to override this behavior. If this is defined to NO, FALSE, or

# {{{ GSKeyBindingsFiles

# An array of strings, (DefaultKeyBindings) by default. The strings in this array (with .dict appended) are the
# names of the files the library reads to load the keybindings. For each of these files (in the order), the library
# first tries to read the file with that name from the $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Libraries/Resources/KeyBindings/
# directory, loading all the keybindings it finds in the file, then it loads the similar file from
# $GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT and then the similar one from $GNUSTEP_NETWORK_ROOT and at last the one from
# $GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT. If you have a single set of customized keybindings which you want to be loaded in addition to
# the default ones (or overriding some of the default ones), just add a DefaultKeybindings.dict file in your
# ~/GNUstep/Libraries/Resources/KeyBindings/ directory, and keybindings from this file are automatically loaded in
# addition to the default ones; you do not need to change this user default. If instead you want more keybinding
# files to be loaded, or you do not want the system default keybindings file to be loaded, you might well need to
# change it.

# A dictionary, containing keybindings which are loaded by the library after the ones found in the
