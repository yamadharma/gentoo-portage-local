# Specifies the default socks server to be used when making outgoing tcp/ip connections using NSFileHandle. This may

# {{{ Zombies

# NSZombieEnabled
# If this is set to YES, then deallocation of an object causes the object to be morphed into a Zombie ... a special
# object which will call the GNUstep specific GSLogZombie() function to log the method call.
# You can set a breakpoint in this function and examine the process memory if you are running under a debugger.
# As this overrides actual object deallocation, all memory allocated for objects will be leaked!

#NSZombieEnabled=NO

# NSDeallocateZombies
# This may be used in conjunction with NSZombieEnabled to specify whether the objects should really be deallocated.
# If you set this to YES, the zombie logging will only work until the deallocated memory is re-used.

# {{{ CRASH_ON_ABORT

# The default exception handler will either cause the program to simply terminate, or to crash - leaving a core
# dump. The standard behavior is to leave a core dump if the library was built for debugging, and to simply exit if
# it was not.

# The CRASH_ON_ABORT environment variable can be used to override this behavior. If this is defined to NO, FALSE, or
# 0 then the program will simply exit when an exception occurs. Any other value of the variable will cause the
# program to generate a core dump.
