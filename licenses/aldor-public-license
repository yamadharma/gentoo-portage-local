Rationale
 
This rationale describes the license and is not part of it.
 
This license permits unrestricted use of the material covered if it
is not redistributed outside the recipient's organization, subject to
acceptance of the disclaimer of liability.  Redistribution in full or in
part, or creation of derivative works is permitted including the use of
all or part of the material in a commercial package.  The first three
clauses that control redistribution follow the well-established BSD
license. The fourth clause is present for two reasons:
 
* Parts of the existing code base in the software package that this license is
  applied to require Aldor.org to make any updates available to the initial
  contributors. The clause is there to give Aldor.org the right to do this.
 
* It reserves for major contributors, through Aldor.org, greater flexibility to
  create and exploit potential future software based on this work, and protects
  them where they have existing non-open software that is related to or shares
  some code with this work.
 
When part or all of the code licensed here is incorporated into a distinct work
our intent is not to lay claim to rights to the larger work as a whole: we just
assert rights over the changes to the Aldor.org software developed in the
process of making it fit to be embedded in the new context.
 
This does not give Aldor.org (or anybody else) exclusive rights to changes.
The license permits (and Aldor.org encourages) those who make changes to
distribute the whole of their work in source form thus giving everybody (not
just Aldor.org) rights to make commercial or non-commercial use of everything.
 
Typical programs compiled with the Aldor compiler contain portions of the
Aldor distribution (e.g. code inlined or linked from the library or run-time
system).  Aldor.org does not wish to limit the distribution of programs
compiled with the Aldor compiler even though these may incidentally contain
portions of such object code from the library or run-time system.
