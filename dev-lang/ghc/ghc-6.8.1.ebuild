# Brief explanation of the bootstrap logic:
#
# Previous ghc ebuilds have been split into two: ghc and ghc-bin,
# where ghc-bin was primarily used for bootstrapping purposes.
# From now on, these two ebuilds have been combined, with the
# binary USE flag used to determine whether or not the pre-built
# binary package should be emerged or whether ghc should be compiled
# from source.  If the latter, then the relevant ghc-bin for the
# arch in question will be used in the working directory to compile
# ghc from source.
#
# This solution has the advantage of allowing us to retain the one
# ebuild for both packages, and thus phase out virtual/ghc.

# Note to users of hardened gcc-3.x:
#
# If you emerge ghc with hardened gcc it should work fine (because we
# turn off the hardened features that would otherwise break ghc).
# However, emerging ghc while using a vanilla gcc and then switching to
# hardened gcc (using gcc-config) will leave you with a broken ghc. To
# fix it you would need to either switch back to vanilla gcc or re-emerge
# ghc (or ghc-bin). Note that also if you are using hardened gcc-3.x and
# you switch to gcc-4.x that this will also break ghc and you'll need to
# re-emerge ghc (or ghc-bin). People using vanilla gcc can switch between
# gcc-3.x and 4.x with no problems.
