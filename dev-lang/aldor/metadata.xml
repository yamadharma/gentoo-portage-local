From a technical point of perspective, Aldor is a type-complete,
strongly-typed, imperative programming language with a two-level
object model of categories and domains (similar to the concept of
interfaces and classes in Java). Types and functions are first class
entities allowing them to be constructed and manipulated within
Aldor programs just like any other value. Pervasive use of dependent
types allows static checking of dynamic objects and provides
object-oriented features such as parametric polymorphism.
